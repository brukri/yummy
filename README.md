## Installation
### Prerequisites

Create an host alias by adding the following line to your `etc/hosts` file:
`127.0.0.1       yummy`

Create the file `./src/app/services/apiKey.ts` with the exported spoonacular API key from `rapidapi.com`:
`export const apiKey = 'yourKey';`

### Development server

Run `npm start` to start a dev server with a recording/replay HTTP mock proxy. This proxy will intercept all calls to spoonacular.com and will save all HTTP reponses. This will reduce the API calls to spoonacular.com and thus lower the costs.

Navigate to `http://yummy:4200/` to open yummy.

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project for development.

Run `npm run build.prod` to build the project for production.

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests
Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests
